# Client-Server-Practice
This is a basic and simple Client-Server connection program by Socket Programming.

## Usage
1. Run the server script file (```Server.py```) to be able to recieve connections from client.
2. Run the client script file (```Client.py```) to connect to the listening server.
3. You will receive a message indicating the success of a connection, then the client's socket will close while the server will remain open for more connections until it's manually closed.

That's all :)
